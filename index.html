            <h2 id="subtitle">Adventures in Europe</h2>
            <div class="description">I was born in a European country, not one that many people visit or can locate on a map, but a European
                country nonetheless: Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sometimes I forget how to spell it in English. Anyway, that's my
                origin story. Born during the war, sent to America. Twelve years later, we visited again for the first time. Then again
                two years later...then again three years later. Somewhere within that time, I studied abroad in France and was lucky enough to
                be able to travel to several different countries in the meantime. I present to you a random assortment of European countries I've stepped
                foot in (and taken pictures of my feet in, because apparently I thought it was cool to see my feet on different unidentifying pavement and grass). 
                Below is the view from my grandparents' field, and probably one of my favorite places in the world.

                <h2 class="main_title">Bosnia</h2>
                <p>My trip in 2014 is probably the most memorable time I spent in Bosnia, and most likely the last time I'll visit. My family lives in a little
                    town known as Marin Most. There are maybe fifty people in the whole town, so it's always a big deal when we visit and get to catch up after
                    years of not seeing each other. In this visit, we took to a trip to the small coastline that Bosnia has, a city called Neum. For such a small
                    section of land, it really feels like a luxurious getaway.

                <h2 class="main_title">France</h2>
                <p>I was lucky enough to get a chance to study abroad in France my junior year of college. I lived in Lille, a city in northern France just
                    about fifteen minutes from the Belgian border. Lille is also one of the rainiest cities in France, and after about a week I gave up my mangled umbrella and my
                    raincoat became a second skin. One of the best things about France is the lax culture, where people are legally only allowed to work thirty-five hours a week and spending
                    an hour eating breakfast is almost mandatory. I traveled to Paris (honestly overrated), Dunkirk (one of the most beautiful coastlines I've ever seen), Lyon (a city that seems almost orange it's bathed in so much sunlight),
                    and a bunch of small, coastal towns where I ate a lot of ice cream and traditional French cuisine like vegetable stew made with white wine, sausages covered in cheese, and plates and plates of cheese and meat.

                <h2 class="main_title">Croatia</h2>
                <p>Our home in Bosnia is just a short drive from Croatia, another European country that was a part of former Yugoslavia. They speak the same language
                    as we do in Bosnia, just with a different dialect. We go to Croatia for the beaches. They're nothing like beaches in America; they're rocky and the 
                    water is usually way too cold to swim in, since the Adriatic Sea doesn't get very warm. I still go swimming every time we're there, though I 
                    quickly end up back in the sun, shivering and covered in saltwater.

                <h2 class="main_title">Spain</h2>
                <p>My time in Spain was spent in Barcelona with three other girls, where we proceeded to reenact The Cheetah Girls whenever we were 
                    in a location we recognized from the movie. The most endearing part of Spain was their ability to take life very slowly; they woke up 
                    much later than us, which means they eat much later, which means the first day we walked into a restaurant at noon looking for lunch they 
                    told us lunch doesn't get served until two in the afternoon. Which means we were very hungry for a while that first day. Sunny, warm Barcelona was 
                    quite a departure from rainy, gloomy Lille, France, and it was probably the one time in six months we were able to wear shorts.

                <h2 class="main_title">Belgium</h2>
                <p>The best part of Belgium was hands-down the Chocolate Museum, which is exactly as wonderful as it sounds. Samples throughout the building,
                    sculptures made of chocolate, and the whole history of chocolate told through pictures and stories. The French fry museum was also very neat, and
                    at the end we got to sample different French fry cuts and seasonings. Obviously my favorite part of traveling to Belgium was getting to eat.</p>
